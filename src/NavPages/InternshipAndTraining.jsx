          The Arisezen  Foundation has the mission of providing job skills training
          and placement for underprivileged youth into entry-level white-collar
          jobs in India. These types of jobs tend to give these youth higher
          income levels than the regular blue-collar work they are offered,
          which helps to substantially raise the economic position of their
          under-resourced families.

          The Arisezen  Foundation incorporates an Al-driven EdTech platform to
          develop English Communications, Selling Skills, Problem Solving,
          Collaboration, Professionalism & Industry Knowledge in students within
          a 45-day period.

          Over the last two years, Arisezen  Foundation has trained 15000+ low-income
          youth to get jobs in the BFSI Sector at average salaries between Rs.
          2.40 Lakh to Rs. 3.00 Lakh per annum.

        Arisezen  Foundation provides Diploma courses in areas like BFSI, ITES,
          Digital Marketing etc and uses a blended learning platform which

        Arisezen's employability model is capital efficient, as its technology
          infrastructure and admin costs are subsidised by its sister company
          Smart Institute Pvt. Ltd. More than 90% of funds raised are used for
          implementing its skilling projects. Around 15000+ students in Mumbai
          have been trained to get jobs in the BFSI sector through grant funding
          from JP Morgan and other funders at salaries up to Rs. 450,000/ per
          annum.

          We aim to expand our reach to train 1 million students in Indian tier
          two cities like Nashik, Pune, Vadodara, Indore, and Ahmedabad. We are
          looking for additional funding partners and NGOs to help us reach this
          goal.
